# Openmaize-example

Work in progress

The plan is for this to be an example of using Openmaize, an authentication
library, in a Phoenix web application. At the moment, though, Openmaize
is not ready to be used, and so this repository is being used to provide
some examples of how to use Comeonin, a password hashing library.
